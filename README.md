# Mapbox Map with Marker

This project demonstrates how to integrate **Mapbox** into a webpage, displaying an interactive map with a marker at a specified location.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For basic styling of the map container.
- **JavaScript**: For creating the Mapbox map and marker.
- **Mapbox GL JS**: For rendering the map and controlling map interactions.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: The map allows zooming and panning.
- **Marker Placement**: A marker is placed at a specific longitude and latitude.
- **Custom Map Style**: The map uses the "streets-v9" style from Mapbox.
- **Globe Projection**: The map is displayed using the `globe` projection for a 3D view of the Earth.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**:
   - Clone or download the repository.
   - Ensure the following files are in place:
     - `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the map and marker code.

2. **Running the Project**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
   - The map will load, centered at the specified coordinates (`[77.12, 11.02]`), with a marker placed at the center.

## Example

```html
<div id="map"></div
